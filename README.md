## Description

WIF Decoder is a small CLI script for converting a Bitcoin private key encoded in the [Wallet Import Format (WIF)](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Wallet_import_format) into a hexadecimal private key.

### Test Vectors
The core Base58 decoder is tested against test vectors sourced from the [Base58 IETF Docs.](https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-msporny-base58-01.html#rfc.section.5)

This library is tested against a single test vector sourced from [the WIF docs.](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Wallet_import_format)
